          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>ROS</mark> (Robot Operating System) and it has since grown into a fully-built robot. I have learned many skills through this and I'm very proud to have improved my knowledge in the robotic area. In resume, the concept of the project is to build an electric autonomous vehicle with electronic parts and sensors, and the software where was a development of a method to navigate the robot from one point to another realizing obstacle avoidance. This objective was concluded with the utilization of potential fields for path planning and obstacle avoidance and the Kalman Filter for the localization of the robot. In this project, I worked with IMU, LIDAR, Micro Controller Raspberry, Motor Drivers Controllers, PID Control, PWM drive, Encoder, A/D Converters, and others.

            Working in the development of a system to make mobile robots autonomous utilizing ROS. Is being created the control velocity of the vehicle and its navigation system based on the implementation of sensors like cameras, LIDARs, Encoders, GPS, and others. The codes are developed using Python and C++ and are tested using a simulator created with GAZEBO.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
